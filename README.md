### Tech

https://hifumi.io is made using parcel which compiles:

* Pug templates
* Scss

Netlify builds automatically from `master` so your changes are 
a single pull request away from going live!

### Contributing

1. `git clone https://github.com/Xetera/hifumi.io.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Go to the address it gave you, and work away!
